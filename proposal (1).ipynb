    "## Introduction\n",
    "A key factor in employee happiness is financial compensation, and past work during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that working remotely can also have a positive impact on happiness thanks to increased employee autonomy. (Card et al., 2012; Galanti et al., 2021). Our analysis aims to explore the relationships between different data science jobs, their salaries, and their proportions doing remote work. Our analyses can inform prospective emplyees about each position's remote work flexibility and typical salary. Employees may use these inferences to discover new data science occupations that better align with their work-life goals."

    "Our research utilizes the dataset \"Data Science Job Salaries\" by Ruchi Bhatia (2022) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries). Observations include the year the salary was paid, experience level, work kind, title, salary, remote ratio, firm size, and company location. The main observations we aim to use are the ```job_title``` to tell us the job type, the ```salary_in_USD``` to inform us about each role's salary, and the ```remote_ratio``` to give us the proportion of poeple working remotely in that respective role.\n"
