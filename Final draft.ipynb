    "A key factor in employee happiness is financial compensation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have shown that working remotely can also have a positive impact on happiness. (Card et al., 2012; Galanti et al., 2021). The data science salaries analysis weâ€™ve performed aims to explore the relationships between different data science jobs, their salaries, and their proportions doing remote work. This would help prospective employees to find jobs that match their own hopes and aspirations, as well as create a work environment that is productive in and out of the workplace by influencing work-life balance.\n"

    "In this project, we use the dataset, \"Data Science Job Salaries\", by Ruchi Bhatia (2022) from Kaggle. It contains both qualitative and quantitative observations we can harness, like the year the salary was paid, experience level, employment type, title, salary, remote ratio, company size, and company location.\n",
    "From this dataset, our variables of interest are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```salary_in_usd``` is our response variable, it uses a single currency (USD) to make comparisons easier regardless of country.\n",
    "* ```job_title``` is one of our explanatory variables; a chr describing each employee's profession.\n",
    "* ```remote_ratio``` is another explanatory variable; a fct describing each employee's ratio of remote work (0 = less than 20%, 50 = in between, 100 = greater than 80%). For this project, we will consider a value of 100 indicative of working remotely\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ```experience_level``` is a factor that affects salary in the data science field, it is not something job seekers can control when searching for a job. This project aims to assist potential employees in selecting a suitable job by considering multiple variables, including experience level and other relevant factors, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the job market in data science.\n"

    "This analysis has so far shown that the average salaries for data engineers and data analysts are different, as well as the percentage of those workers that work from home. Moreover, the sample standard deviation of pay is larger for data engineers, and both standard deviations for the proportion of remote work are similar.
