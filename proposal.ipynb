    "Due to increased autonomy, studies have shown that working remotely has had a positive impact on contentment during the pandemic. One of the key factors in employee happiness is financial compensation (Card et al., 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these two facts, this research intends to inform those joining the data science job market about pay and the chance of working remotely for each type of position. By influencing work-life balance, this would help employees discover occupations that align with their own goals and objectives and foster a work climate that is productive both on and off the job."
